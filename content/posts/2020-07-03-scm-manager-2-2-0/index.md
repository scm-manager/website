Since SCM-Manager 1 it has been the [most wanted feature](https://github.com/scm-manager/scm-manager/issues/393), and now finally you can change the namespace and the name of your repositories. Just take a look at the new "Danger Zone" in the repository settings.

Another little feature is the capability to link to commits/changesets in other repositories in your commit messages and markdown documents like READMEs. Just use the format `namespace/name@revision`, eg. `cloudogu/scm-manager@1234567`.

Thanks to you, we were able to find and fix some bugs regarding the installation on various operating systems as well as the migration process. Keep this going.
