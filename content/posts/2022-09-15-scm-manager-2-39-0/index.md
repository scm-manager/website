Hello SCM-Manager Community,

over a month has passed since our last feature release during which we have taken the time to round up some significant
additions to our global search. Two brand-new plugins are ready for you in addition to several quality of life improvements
and bugfixes.

## New Plugin: Commit Search

## New Plugin: Binary Search

## Manual Reindex

## What's coming next ?

We are currently working hard on integrating keyboard shortcuts to first the search and then to other parts of the application.
As with any newly trodden terrain, we want to move carefully and ensure proper function and quality before making it available
in our next minor release.

## Closing words
