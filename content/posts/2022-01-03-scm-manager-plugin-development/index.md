Hey SCM-Manager Community,

It's the first monday of the new year, and we just started working on the next major features to improve your SCM-Manager experience.
But before going forward we wanted to do a little recap and share our highlights regarding SCM-Manager of 2021.

## Recap
We had 16 minor releases in the last year including these big features/changes:
- Repository Import and Export for Git, HG and Subversion
- Frontend rebuild with react-query which dramatically improved the performance
- Metrics for SCM-Manager which can be collected with the related plugins as [JSON](https://scm-manager.org/plugins/scm-metrics-json-plugin/) or [PromQL](https://scm-manager.org/plugins/scm-metrics-prometheus-plugin/)
- Global Notification System
- Repository Mirroring with the [Repository Mirror Plugin](https://scm-manager.org/plugins/scm-repository-mirror-plugin/)
- Global search for most entities in SCM-Manager
- Rebuild of the repository overview
- High Contrast Mode and improved accessibility in general
- Introduction of the Cloudogu Plugin Center (with more features to come)

Besides, the core changes we also added some helpful plugins which can lift your SCM-Manager workflows into a new level.
We cannot explain all plugins here, but we strongly recommend having a look for the following:

- [Gotenberg Plugin](https://scm-manager.org/plugins/scm-gotenberg-plugin/) - Renders office files like Word or Excel inside your SCM-Manager file view
- [Landingpage Plugin](https://scm-manager.org/plugins/scm-landingpage-plugin/) - Shows a personal page for each user including all related information
- [Content Search](https://scm-manager.org/plugins/scm-content-search-plugin/) - Enables search inside the files of your repositories

## Blog Post Series

We are aware that we are mostly developers and marketing seems not to be our greatest strength. SCM-Manager is getting bigger 
and more complex with every release. So we working against this trend to make plugin development easier and more accessible to everyone. 
If you are interested in developing your own SCM-Manager plugins we would love to share our knowledge and support your plugin.

Some month ago we released a guide to create your first SCM-Manager plugin with real examples. 
You can read this series of 3 on the [Cloudogu Blog](https://cloudogu.com/en/blog/scm-manager-plugin-development-intro_en). 

## Final words
Even with the world going crazy it seems the last year was not that bad for SCM-Manager. 
We still have many cards up our sleeves to deliver some exciting features.
