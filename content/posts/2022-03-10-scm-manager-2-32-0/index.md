Hey SCM-Manager Community,

for the last month we focused on theming as we introduced the new dark mode. Besides, we worked on giving you the
opportunity to provide feedback directly from SCM-Manager.

## Dark mode
As high contrast mode targeted accessibility we also were in need for a more relaxed dark theme. The new official
dark mode has more relaxed colors which might help if you have to code late at night.

## Feedback
We would like to get more feedback from you the user, and therefore we tried to make it more simple to provide us
feedback directly from within the SCM-Manager. You can use the button in the lower right corner to display a form and
easily submit your thoughts, suggestions and compliments.
