## Migration in progress

As previously announced, all SCM-Manager repositories are being migrated to GitHub, because Bitbucket has announced the ending support for Mercurial.

Soon, all repositories will be available under the [SCM-Manager organization](https://github.com/scm-manager) on GitHub. It is our goal to have all repositories migrated within the next two weeks.

Once all the repositories are on GitHub, we will get onto migrating the issues and the wiki.
