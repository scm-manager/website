Version 1.2 of the [scm-userrepo-plugin](https://bitbucket.org/sdorra/scm-userrepo-plugin) is available.

**Changes:**

- Allow administrators to define a name pattern for new repositories created by normal users

With this version it is possible for users to create repositories in a scheme similar to bitbucket or github (username/repositoryname).
