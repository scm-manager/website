There are two new plugins available. The first one is for <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenkins</a> and will ping your Jenkins CI server when a new commit is pushed to SCM-Manager.  
The second plugin is for the issue tracker <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atlassian JIRA</a> and will turn Issue-Keys into links.
