Hey SCM-Manager community,

as we progress with the SCM-Manager development we have figured out that we should integrate some more features for Mercurial to keep up with our Git development.
But since we don't want to bloat SCM-Manager with unused gimmicks, we are not sure which features are actually desired by the users.

We created a short survey were you can tell us exactly which features you want for the next SCM-Manager releases.
We will try our best to deliver your most voted features asap.
