Hey SCM-Manager Community,

we have discovered a vulnerability in the CAS plugin that allows an attacker to hijack accounts of other users.
This could have potentially allowed unauthorized access to actions the hijacked user could perform in SCM-Manager.

We've now updated the scm-cas-plugin to fix this, making sure access is secure. Please [update your plugin](https://scm-manager.org/plugins/scm-cas-plugin/releases/) version!
If you are currently using a 2.x version, please upgrade to 2.5.1.
If you are currently using a 3.x version, please upgrade to 3.3.2.

If you don't use the CAS plugin, you are not affected by this issue. 
We take security seriously and are always working to keep our platform safe. Thanks for your understanding.
