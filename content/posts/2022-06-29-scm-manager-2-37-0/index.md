Hello SCM-Manager Community,

with a fresh release come new, exciting features that we do not want to keep from you. Beside the usual
bugfixes, we want to highlight three additions/changes.

## Git-LFS Support when Mirroring Repositories

A quite subtle, but much requested feature that we had to exclude in the initial
implementation of the repository mirroring due to complexity. It caused our team
many headaches, but ultimately we tamed the beast. Now, you can benefit from our struggles
by mirroring from sources that include git-lfs files. Yes, that includes SCM-Manager 1.x instances!

## New Plugin: External File Links

This latest plugin is useful especially for integrations with external file storage systems, where
you do not want to duplicate data but would still like to include a quick reference in your source code or documentation.

It adds a button to the source action bar where you can simply enter the external file's url and
a file name for your link and voil√†, you just created a new external file link.

To open one of those links, open the file and click the button that is boldly presented to you.

We made it work this way to keep the plugin compatible with other functionality in the SCM-Manager,
as a file link internally is simply a file with a specific format.

Editing links is also possible and works quite similar to editing any other file.

## Updated Email Templates

Last but not least, we have performed a long-overdue tidy-up of the email templates in our [Mail Plugin](https://scm-manager.org/plugins/scm-mail-plugin/).

So if you are, for example, using the [Notify Plugin](https://scm-manager.org/plugins/scm-notify-plugin/): get exited for prettier and more organised emails!

## Closing words
