Hello SCM-Manager Community,

In our previous [post](https://scm-manager.org/blog/posts/2025-05-16-cas-plugin-account-hijacking-vulnerability/), we addressed a vulnerability in the CAS plugin. During our follow-up review, we discovered the same issue in the LDAP plugin.

We’ve released an update that not only patches this vulnerability but also enhances overall access security.

Please [update](https://scm-manager.org/plugins/scm-ldap-plugin/releases/) immediately to the latest scm-ldap-plugin version 3.1.1!


If you don’t use the LDAP plugin, you’re not affected and no action is needed.

Security is our top priority, and we’re continuously working to keep our platform as safe as possible. Thank you for your trust and ongoing support!
